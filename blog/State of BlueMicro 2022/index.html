title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>2021 was an eventful year in the word of wireless mechanical keyboards and BlueMicro. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="wireless-hardware">Wireless Hardware<a class="hash-link" href="#wireless-hardware" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Although BlueMicro was the precursor to many breakout boards now used as controllers for keyboard builds, the <a href="https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice!nano</a> is now the most popular in the mechanical keyboard community, followed by the nRF52840 feather express for handwired builds and the <a href="https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nrfmicro</a> for more adventurous builders. The <a href="https://www.tindie.com/search/?q=bluemicro840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueMicro840</a> is still an option but as my time is limited and they are manually assembled, their supply was limited, even before the chip shortage hit the needed modules (more to come on that...).  For more GPIOs, there is the BlueMacro840 which makes available more GPIOs.</p><p>The first all-in-one keyboards I designed in 2021 was the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/jpconstantineau/2x4-ble-macropad-for-mechanical-switches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHand</a>. A simple 8-keys hand-sized wireless mechanical keyboard that&#x27;s been designed for <a href="https://artsey.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artsey.io</a>; a one-handed keyboard typing system that uses chording for registering keypresses.  </p><p>The chip shortage has affected the supply of processors for many projects. The nrf52840 modules used for the Bluemicro840, BlueHand and nrfmicro became scarce and the few modules that could be found went for 6x their original prices; making the modules even more expensive than a Nice!Nano. </p><p>This has prompted me to create the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/jpconstantineau/ebyte-e73-2g4m08s1e-breakout-bluemicro833-pcba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueMicro833</a>, based on the now available nrf52833 modules which are almost identical to the 840 modules at a similar price as the original nRF52840 modules a year ago.  The most important differences are RAM and Flash sizes.  Unfortunately, firmware support is lacking.  A BlueMicro833 was sent to the ZMK team for testing and it tested fine with ZMK. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="is-new-hardware-even-possible-with-the-chip-shortage">Is new hardware even possible with the chip shortage?<a class="hash-link" href="#is-new-hardware-even-possible-with-the-chip-shortage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In early 2021, Raspberry Pi introduced the RP2040.  The RP2040 is a dual core ARM Cortex M0+ chip with interesting peripherals and is very cheap.  It&#x27;s only wired - no BLE with this chip.  Because the RP2040 is the first microcontroller from Raspberry Pi, it had no pre-existing users (for example, car manufacturers), it saw really good availability, even <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts/componentSearch?isSearch=true&amp;searchTxt=rp2040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JLCPCB</a> has it for PCBA. Circuitpython was available relatively quickly. A few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X00Cm5LMNQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videos are on Youtube</a> on how to design a rp2040 board made the task quite simple.  Raspberry PI even provided a <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/hardware-design-with-rp2040.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference design</a>.  As such, I introduced <a href="https://circuitpython.org/downloads?q=pykey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyKey</a>, a suite of mechanical keyboards with a RP2040 as the processor, starting with <a href="https://circuitpython.org/board/jpconstantineau_pykey60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyKey60</a>, a 60% keyboard based on the GH60 form factor (More sizes are now available: Numpad, TKL, 44-keys Ergo).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="wireless-firmware">Wireless Firmware<a class="hash-link" href="#wireless-firmware" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>QMK has retained the dominant firmware for mechanical keyboards but ZMK became the dominant choice for newcomers to wireless DIY mechanical keyboards. Based on the Zephyr project, it has a good follower base. Just like QMK, it focuses on a readily available firmware and not on basic troubleshooting tools that can help the DIY builder troubleshooting their hardware troubles.  Additionnaly, as ZMK uses the Zephyr BLE stack and not the Nordic SoftDevice, some users have faced issues pairing with some devices (Apple mostly). Some of these users have gone to BlueMicro_BLE and their pairing troubles were resolved. </p><p>Bluemicro_BLE being based on the Arduino nRF52 board support package from Adafruit, is much more friendly in case the user needs to create their own code to troubleshoot their hardware. </p><p>Since Adafruit will only include boards that they <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/pull/596#issuecomment-714900359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell</a> within their nRF52 Arduino Board support package, I created a fork of the BSP (and disconnected it) and created the <a href="https://github.com/jpconstantineau/Community_nRF52_Arduino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Add-On nRF52 Board Support Package</a> to which changes were made; most importantly, the addition of many nRF52 boards and keyboards available to the community.  My decision to split the code base from the source repository was mainly based on the desire remove the problematic code causing <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/issues/600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high current consumption</a>, but also to keep a fork for me to be able to contribute to the main repository while having a separate repo for the Community boards.  Unfortunately, this decision came to bite me when many positive changes were pushed to the Adafruit nRF52 Arduino Board Support Package.</p><p>In order to make more options available for users, support for CircuitPython was added for the BlueMicro840. Circuitpython adds a new framework by which one can code their keyboards and even troubleshoot their hardware. You can go to the <a href="http://pykey.jpconstantineau.com/docs/testing_hardware/keymatrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyKey</a> project to see lots of keyboard troubleshooting tips with CircuitPython.</p><p>CircuitPython also makes <a href="https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KMK</a> an option for BlueMicro840 users. I even designed an ultra-portable wireless keyboard that uses 44 Kailh Thin keys that saw KMK as the first firmware to run on it.  I year ago, I never coded any Python. Today, I can count a few of my keyboards within the <a href="https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/tree/master/boards/jpconstantineau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KMK repo</a>; all Python code I wrote...</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="firmware-for-nrf52833">Firmware for nRF52833<a class="hash-link" href="#firmware-for-nrf52833" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, support for the Nordic nRF52833 in the Arduino IDE is non-existent. There were a <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/pulls?q=is%3Apr++nrf52833+" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few PRs</a> but none were included in the Adafruit nRF52 Arduino Board Support Package. An issue was raised to ask if the nRF52833 Dev Kit from Nordic would be merged in if a PR would be made (even if on a not-supported basis). <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/issues/696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No clear response yet</a>.   Without Arduino support for ths chip, BlueMicro_BLE firmware won&#x27;t be able to run on it.  In the meantime, try CircuitPython,KMK or ZMK!  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="bluemicro_ble">BlueMicro_BLE<a class="hash-link" href="#bluemicro_ble" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>2021 started great for BlueMicro_BLE with the addition of a few great features:</p><ul><li>USB and BLE switching - Wireless and Wired on the same keyboard - switched automatically!</li><li>Mutiple BLE Profiles - making it possible to choose which computer to connect it to</li><li>Combos/chording: a new keycode-based chording engine that replaces keycodes when two or more keycodes are detected.

As such, a staged approach will be taken to update both the <a href="https://github.com/jpconstantineau/BlueMicro_BLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueMicro_BLE</a> firmware and the <a href="https://github.com/jpconstantineau/Community_nRF52_Arduino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Add-On nRF52 Board Support Package</a> to the latest BSP.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="unifying-the-interface-for-usb-and-ble-hid">Unifying the interface for USB and BLE HID<a class="hash-link" href="#unifying-the-interface-for-usb-and-ble-hid" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In 2021, I started the effort to unify the BLE and USB calls into a single library, starting from thr ground up using the HID_Composite examples.  After countless hours of unsuccessful and hair-pulling code streams, I finally have something working.</p><p>I am planning to make a common HID library that handles both BLE on the nRF52 chips and USB on boards with TinyUSB support. This would be publised as an Arduino Library.  By migrating to this library, this means that Bluemicro_BLE will be able to support the nrf52 chips, the RP2040 and the SAMD21 and SAMD51 chips; at least from a single keyboard point of view. Split keyboards would be next.  The prototype code already runs on multiple Adafruit Feathers (nrf52832, nrf52840, RP2040, SAMD21, SAMD51).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="making-mousekeys-work-and-make-sense">Making Mousekeys work (and make sense)<a class="hash-link" href="#making-mousekeys-work-and-make-sense" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Since the unified library described above is based on the HID_Composite examples, the library would enable parallel keyboard/mouse/consumer keyscodes to be sent (as opposed to only one of the 3).

Adding diodes is not always possible as this code is used as part of a Model M keyboard Wireless retrofit.

It would be very useful to be able to create your own SeeSaw device using CircuitPython.  Take a KB2040, a Raspberry Pi Pico, a Feather M4 or a small SAMD21 board and re-purpose it as a SeeSaw co-processor for handling remote input/output devices.  If CircuitPython can&#x27;t be used due to size limitations, an Arduino library for use with the SAMD21 would be useful.  I believe porting the I2C peripheral module to other chips would be the starting  point.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="split-keyboards-and-the-kb2040-and-pro-micro-rp2040">Split keyboards and the KB2040 (and Pro Micro RP2040):<a class="hash-link" href="#split-keyboards-and-the-kb2040-and-pro-micro-rp2040" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To understand the potential issues with the RP2040 on a board with the form factor of the Pro Micro, we need to see a brief history of split keyboards and how communications was handled between the halves. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="a-recent-history-of-split-keyboards">A recent history of split keyboards<a class="hash-link" href="#a-recent-history-of-split-keyboards" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The table below presents a brief list of split keyboards, starting with the Original Ergodox from 2013.

This freed a data line for users to add RGB data between the two halves.  Most builds that used the Let&#x27;s Split as a template used D0 with software serial.  Some kept the option for I2C, others dropped it.</p><p>However, with the addition of I2C OLED screens on the Helix, serial communications between the two halves was relocated to be on D2 (See differences between V1 and V2).  Since D2 is RX, on one side hardware UART can be used but software UART has to be used on the other side.  This allows for 1-way communications.  2-way comms would need to use software serial with some software handshaking to handle direction changes (and perhaps a resistor to limit current in case of TX on both sides at the same time); 2-way serial is probably not generally implemented on a single line due to the additional complexity.  </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="the-problem-with-the-rp2040-and-hardware-uart">The problem with the RP2040 and hardware UART<a class="hash-link" href="#the-problem-with-the-rp2040-and-hardware-uart" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Unlike the nRF52 where any GPIO can be used for I2C and UART, the RP2040 has some restrictions on what functions are available for each GPIO.  If one wants to use non-standard (i.e. not in the table of page 13-14 of the <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datasheet</a>), you have to use the PIO to create your own UART RX or TX (Datasheet Page 373) peripherals.  Since most pro-micro keyboards that used  I2C, relied on hardware for I2C.  However, to keep build flexibility and cost of PCB designs low, the same I2C pins were re-used but for serial.  Serial communications were slao setup with a single line to leave a line free for &quot;RGB Data&quot;.  Using the same data pin on each side allowed for mirrored builds and for the possibility of setting up both sides identically and automatically detecting which side is primary or secondary by monitoring whether USB is connected; hence detecting the desired data direction on the serial line.  </p><p>This means that serial connection of many (if not most) split keyboards will rely on &quot;non-standard&quot; RX/TX pins definition compared to the default Arduino Pro Micro definitions.</p><p>For existing split keyboards to work, we need software UART (or PIO UART) in CircuitPython.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="i2cperipheral-for-other-chips-rp2040-samd21-nrf52-etc">I2CPeripheral for other chips (RP2040, SAMD21, nRF52, etc)<a class="hash-link" href="#i2cperipheral-for-other-chips-rp2040-samd21-nrf52-etc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To enable I2C communications between keyboard halves or to build your own seesaw board using CircuitPython, I2CPeripheral on the RP2040 and other chips is needed.  Once available, a seesaw_peripheral library will be possible.  Possibly leveraging the adafruit_register.i2c_struct.Struct function, perhaps in a bi-directional way: define the same registers on both sides of the communication channel and let the I2C &quot;magic&quot; do its thing...   </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="very-deep-sleep-on-the-nrf52">Very Deep Sleep on the nRF52<a class="hash-link" href="#very-deep-sleep-on-the-nrf52" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I have an <a href="http://pykey.jpconstantineau.com/docs/testing_hardware/sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> that compares ZMK, BlueMicro_BLE and CircuitPython running and sleep current on the same device.  Unlike the other two, CircuitPython isn&#x27;t a compiled language.  As such, power consumption when running will never be able to reach the level of designed-for-purpose compiled code. Nevertheless, when going in deep sleep, the chip shouldn&#x27;t be running and one would expect a comparable current.  Unfortonately, how deep sleep is implemented in CircuitPython is more of a &quot;nap&quot; than a sleep.  The chip regularly wakes up to check the state of alarm pins, then goes back napping until the next check.</p><p>As such, there is the possibility for an even deeper sleep for the nRF52 chips running CircuitPython.  I don&#x27;t know what it should be called as &quot;deep sleep&quot; is already taken. The article mentionned above highlights how it&#x27;s done and how it behaves (full reboot on wake-up).  This &quot;Very Deep Sleep&quot; needs an external pin to be toggled for the wake-up to occur.  For keyboards, a simple keeypress does the job.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="bluemicro833">BlueMicro833<a class="hash-link" href="#bluemicro833" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>  Detailed testing of the Bluemicro 833 with Circuitpython and KMK is needed to see how much useful room is available, both for Ram and Flash space.  Having half the flash and ram as the nRF52840, I suspect that we may run into similar issues as the SAMD21.  The SAMD21 has so little ram that it runs out of it pretty quickly.  The nRF52833 has more, however as this is chip is meant for BLE functions and that the Softdevice consumes a chunk of space already, what&#x27;s left to the user for Python code will be limited.
